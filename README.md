## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a Rust developer focused on building memory-safe, high-performance backend systems. This repository is a collection of my work as I explore how Rustâ€™s powerful type system and strict safety guarantees can be used to create robust server-side applications without sacrificing speed or reliability.

Rust has quickly become my language of choice for backend development, primarily because of its focus on safety, concurrency, and zero-cost abstractions. Iâ€™m particularly interested in how Rust helps eliminate entire classes of bugsâ€”such as null pointer dereferencing and data racesâ€”at compile time, allowing me to write backend code thatâ€™s both safe and efficient.

My work centers around creating backend services, system tools, and APIs that prioritize performance, predictable memory usage, and scalability. Iâ€™m experimenting with web frameworks like Axum and Actix Web, using asynchronous programming with tokio, and integrating database layers through crates like sqlx and diesel.

This repository includes a range of projectsâ€”from small utilities to more complex backend applicationsâ€”each designed to deepen my understanding of Rustâ€™s strengths in system-level and web development. I also pay close attention to code clarity, modular architecture, and testing to ensure these projects are as maintainable as they are performant.

If you're also working with Rust or interested in writing safe, reliable backends, feel free to explore the code, open an issue, or suggest improvements. Iâ€™m always looking to learn from others in the community and share what Iâ€™ve learned along the way.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and hereâ€™s to building faster, safer systems, one line of Rust at a time.
